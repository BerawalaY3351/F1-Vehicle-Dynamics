## Aerodynamic Efficiency Simulator
This template is a driver focused aerodynamic efficiency simulator designed to model and analyse the impact of aerodynamic forces on vehicle performance across varying speed conditions.

The simulator provides a simplified but structured framework to evaluate drag, downforce, and performance stability similar to early-stage modelling tools used in race performance and vehicle dynamics analysis.


🔧 Core Features
**1. Drag and Downforce Modelling**

Simulates aerodynamic forces acting on the vehicle, including:

- Aerodynamic drag force

- Downforce generation

- Resulting net vertical load changes

The model uses speed-dependent aerodynamic equations to reflect realistic force scaling.

**2. Speed-Based Analysis**

Evaluates aerodynamic efficiency across a configurable speed range, allowing:

- Force curve generation across low to high speeds

- Stability analysis at race-relevant velocity bands

- Comparative evaluation between setups

**3. Customisable Parameters**

Supports dynamic parameter adjustment to simulate setup changes, including:

- Wing angle variations

- Ride height adjustments

- Drag coefficient tuning

- Frontal area changes

This allows testing how setup decisions influence aerodynamic balance.

**4. Performance Metrics**

Computes and analyses key aerodynamic efficiency metrics:

- Lift-to-Drag Ratio (L/D)

- Total aerodynamic load

- Energy consumption due to drag

- Speed stability indicators

These metrics help quantify trade-offs between straight-line speed and cornering grip.

**5. Visualisation Tools**

Generates detailed plots to support performance interpretation, including:

- Drag vs Speed

- Downforce vs Speed

- Lift-to-Drag Ratio curves

- Energy loss due to drag

- Comparative setup visualisations

The visual outputs allow rapid assessment of aerodynamic efficiency trends.

**🎯 Purpose**

This simulator serves as a foundational tool for:

- Understanding aerodynamic trade-offs

- Supporting race strategy simulations

- Integrating telemetry data for performance modelling

- Expanding toward lap time simulation and vehicle dynamics modelling

It is part of a broader motorsport analytics and race performance engineering portfolio.
